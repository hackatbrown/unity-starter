# Unity Starter Kit
## An introduction to the essentials of the Unity3D Game Engine.
To start, this repo includes a folder of scripts for the basic logic you need to build your game, like player and camera movement. <br />
We've included a manual PDF with helpful tips, resource links, and a navigation guide to the software. <br />
The manual also includes a download link to a **demo project** to help show the basic features of Unity. <br />

## Happy hacking!!
