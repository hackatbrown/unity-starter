# Unity Starter Kit

## What is Unity?
Unity is a popular game development platform. Developers primarily use C# to write scripts within Unity, which allows them to create interactive 2D and 3D games and simulations. Unity provides a comprehensive development environment (see below) with a user-friendly interface, powerful physics engines, and support for a wide range of platforms. <br />

## An introduction to the essentials of the Unity3D Game Engine.
To get started, this repo includes a folder of scripts for the basic logic you need to build your game, such as player and camera movement. <br />
We've also included a manual PDF with helpful tips, resource links, and a navigation guide to the software. Be sure to check it out if you are new to Unity as the manual guides you through all of the basics of Unity. The manual also includes download links to [Unity](https://unity.com/download) and a [demo project](https://www.mediafire.com/file/xrnos360i927mzi/DemoProject.zip/file) to help show the basic features of Unity. <br />
If you have any other questions, please check out the Resources section at the end of the manual or contact us anytime. <br />

## Happy Hacking!!
